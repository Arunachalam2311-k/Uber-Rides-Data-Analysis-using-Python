## Uber-Rides-Data-Analysis-using-Python

# Project Overview
The **Uber Rides Data Analysis** project explores Uber ride data to gain insights into user behavior and travel patterns. By utilizing various visualizations and analyses, this project aims to uncover trends related to ride durations, distances, and the reasons users choose Uber services.

## Problem Statement
The main objective of this project is to analyze Uber ride data to understand user travel patterns, peak usage times, and the purpose of rides. This analysis seeks to answer questions such as:
- What factors influence the frequency of Uber rides?
- Which times of day see the highest usage?
- How does the purpose of the ride affect the distance traveled?

## Data Description
The dataset used in this analysis includes the following key columns:
- **`START_DATE`**: Timestamp indicating when the ride began.
- **`END_DATE`**: Timestamp indicating when the ride concluded.
- **`PURPOSE`**: The reason for the ride (e.g., business, personal).
- **`MILES`**: Distance traveled during the ride (in miles).
- **`DURATION`**: Total duration of the ride (in minutes).
- Additional derived columns:
  - **`day_name`**: The name of the day the ride started.
  - **`time_label`**: Categorical representation of the time of day (e.g., Night, Morning).
  - **`month`**: The month in which the ride took place.
  - **`duration`**: The calculated ride duration in minutes.

## Technologies Used
This project utilizes the following technologies:
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - `Pandas` for data manipulation and analysis.
  - `Matplotlib` and `Seaborn` for data visualization.
